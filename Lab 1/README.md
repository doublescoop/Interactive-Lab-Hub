# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like.

## Part A. Plan 


Setting: The interaction will happen in the dog owner’s(Esther’s) living space, where the dog(Mika) normally eats and drinks. It will be in the middle of the day when the dog owner’s usually caught up with some busy work. 
Players: Primarily, the dog owner and the dog are the main players in this interaction. However, anyone who’s sharing the space with the owner(roommate, visitor, colleague) can be involved. 

Activity and goals: In our scenario, the dog owner is forgetting to refill the dog’s food/water/both. The dog is trying to be patient but finds herself annoyed and thirsty. The dog’s goal here is to act as an annoyed pet ignored by the owner(and arouse some sympathy from the audience? lol). The owner annoys the dog even more by walking past the bowls without noticing it. Working on her desk for hours, the owner finally realizes it when the [device] starts emitting very bright light. Her goals are to walk past the bowls, and then notice the light, and then go do the refilling. She immediately refills the bowls. Doggo happy. She’s happy. The light will be turned off automatically. 

Background: Esther and Soul are teammates, and Esther has a dog named Mika. Since Esther is busy throughout the day, she sometimes forgets to fill food or water for Mika. Mika has to wait for a long time until Esther realizes that, especially when Esther is not home. She sometimes asks Soul to check Mika’s bowls and add food/water if needed, but Soul also forgets to do so sometimes. Sometimes, Esther would feel bad for having to ask Soul explicitly all the time and would not do so.

Function: With this [device name Doggolight??] placed in the living space, Esther can easily notice whether food or water needs to be refilled without having to bend down and check Mika’s bowls constantly. This lighting device is activated by the weights of the connected bowls. When it drops below 50g, it will notify the humans by emitting bright-colored lights: Blue for water refill only, orange for food refill only, and red for both.
The light will automatically turn off when the bowls are filled, which saves Esther and Soul time and effort. They don’t need to manually check if the bowls are empty anymore. Instead, they can tell through the light if any bowl needs to be refilled. The light will be noticeable enough given the brightness and the special color choices that will hardly be used in daily lives. 


Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Having a non-verbal nudge to remind the dog owner to feed and take care of the dog sounds helpful. The location of the light in the room might be important so it cannot be missed by the humans but also not disturbing the space too much. You could add a beeping sound when the bowl was not filled after n-minutes of blinking. -- Michelle Wang

For different dog sizes, it will be great to set the lower bound for the weight of each bowl as dogs with different sizes eat/drink different amounts of food/water. -- Scarlett Zhang



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
As in one of the feedbacks, where the device is located is really important. We tried with many different places but were worried that it would not be that noticeable. We first tried to stick the device on the wall where the bowls are located, but it could also be ignored when we acted it out. So we chose to put it on a higher side table next to the bowls. 

Also, we planned to use the smart lamp at the beginning, but the lamp was hard to costume while we had a better idea of how the device would look like. So eventually we decided to use the phone that can be costumed to how we think the device should look like.


\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


We initially planned for two scenarios, one for food only and one for water only. I chose to act out the interaction when I woke up in the morning as food would be usually eaten up by every morning, and I realized that water was out as well. Under such circumstances, a decision needed to be made regarding which color to show first if both are out, and a sequence needed to be performed as well if I add food/water one after the other. To simplify everything, we decided to add another color to the device, which is red when both need to be refilled. 



## Part C. Prototype the device


Unfortunately, we were unable to make Tinkerbelle on our phones. We got the python file to run successfully on our laptop with the port number, but we could never get connected to the port on our phones following the instructions. Therefore to save time, we decided to use another way to show different colors. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
  We intended the device to have a look that could intuitively imply that it has something to do with the pet. So even the first-time users can go check the dog when they notice the lighting. We went with the rounded bone shape which is simple yet has enough space in the middle for a lighting panel, and a good weight-balance. We intended the shape to be something cute rather than an emotionless shape like a rectangle. This could arouse some sympathy to go take care of the dog as soon as possible.  One of the major concerns was that we wanted to have a stable shape that can be placed on a desk easily. Also, the shape should have enough space for the lighting panel, which was the size of the phone screen in this case. 


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
To summarize, there are three points made in the feedback we got:
1. Location of where the device should be put could be changed so that the device could be more noticeable.
2. Light notification sometimes could be hard to notice, especially when it is daytime or other light sources are on. Hence, sound notification was mentioned in some feedback.
3. If the pet finishes the food within a short period of time and if the light for food refill is on right after the food is finished, the pet could possibly be overfed.

## Make it your own

To address the three points mentioned in the previous section, we made the following improvements to our Doggolight device:

- We placed the device at multiple locations so it is easier to be noticed by the user.
    The placement of the device can be personalized. In our case, we considered the occasions when it’s easy to forget about feeding the pet. So we put one on the desk where the user tends to work by, one on the door for when the user is leaving without refilling the water/food. On top of those two places, we also considered usability, so we placed one near the water dispenser where the user gets water for himself. 

- We added a sound notification that will be triggered once every 10 min when it’s not in the “Do Not Disturb” period from 12 am to 7 am. 
		  We got three feedback suggesting some additional auditory notification on top of the lighting. There were some concerns about the light being not so noticeable in the living space especially when there are other light sources on. So we added a sound notification to the device while keeping the light feature. Instead of a beeping sound, we added a voice notification for three different scenarios that correspond to the three colors the light will emit: “Please add water”, “Please add food” and “Please add food and water”. Specifying the instruction can prevent the user from having to check the color of the light or the emptiness of the bowl again after hearing the sound. 
    Also, considering that the sound notification might be annoying when the user is asleep at night, we set a "Do Not Disturb" period. Within the period, no sound notification will be played. Instead, lights will be the only means of notification.
     
- We added a feature that takes the feeding intervals into account. Once the food is added, the sensor for the food bowl will sleep for 6 hours in case the pet finishes the food right away to ensure that the pet is not overfed.
    This is also from one of the feedback we got mentioning the overfeeding problem in case the pet finishes the food in a really short amount of time. To prevent this from happening, we added a feature to the device that will have the food bowl sensor sleep for a certain amount of time, in our case 6 hours before detecting if the food bowl is empty the next time so that if the sound and the light for adding food is triggered, users could add food without worrying that their pets eat too much.

While we kept the same costume for the device we had for part 1, we added new functions to the original design of the device. We staged the new interaction with the added sound notification, and with multiple locations of the device.

These updates in the design also affected our way of video-taking. We had to record nine separate videos for the three locations and for each color of the light. 

We also made some changes to the layout of the video. We showed the status of the bowls (food empty, water empty, both empty) before each scenario, and with the help of the sound notification, we used fewer subtitles that could be disturbing. Moreover, we added some explanations at the end of the video to show we have the feeding interval function and Do-not-disturb mode as well.
