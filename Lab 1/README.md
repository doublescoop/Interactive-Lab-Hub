# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like.

## Part A. Plan 


Setting: The interaction will happen in the dog owner’s(Esther’s) living space, where the dog(Mika) normally eats and drinks. It will be in the middle of the day when the dog owner’s usually caught up with some busy work. 
Players: Primarily, the dog owner and the dog are the main players in this interaction. However, anyone who’s sharing the space with the owner(roommate, visitor, colleague) can be involved. 

Activity and goals: In our scenario, the dog owner is forgetting to refill the dog’s food/water/both. The dog is trying to be patient but finds herself annoyed and thirsty. The dog’s goal here is to act as an annoyed pet ignored by the owner(and arouse some sympathy from the audience? lol). The owner annoys the dog even more by walking past the bowls without noticing it. Working on her desk for hours, the owner finally realizes it when the [device] starts emitting very bright light. Her goals are to walk past the bowls, and then notice the light, and then go do the refilling. She immediately refills the bowls. Doggo happy. She’s happy. The light will be turned off automatically. 

Background: Esther and Soul are teammates, and Esther has a dog named Mika. Since Esther is busy throughout the day, she sometimes forgets to fill food or water for Mika. Mika has to wait for a long time until Esther realizes that, especially when Esther is not home. She sometimes asks Soul to check Mika’s bowls and add food/water if needed, but Soul also forgets to do so sometimes. Sometimes, Esther would feel bad for having to ask Soul explicitly all the time and would not do so.

Function: With this [device name Doggolight??] placed in the living space, Esther can easily notice whether food or water needs to be refilled without having to bend down and check Mika’s bowls constantly. This lighting device is activated by the weights of the connected bowls. When it drops below 50g, it will notify the humans by emitting bright-colored lights: Blue for water refill only, orange for food refill only, and red for both.
The light will automatically turn off when the bowls are filled, which saves Esther and Soul time and effort. They don’t need to manually check if the bowls are empty anymore. Instead, they can tell through the light if any bowl needs to be refilled. The light will be noticeable enough given the brightness and the special color choices that will hardly be used in daily lives. 


Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Having a non-verbal nudge to remind the dog owner to feed and take care of the dog sounds helpful. The location of the light in the room might be important so it cannot be missed by the humans but also not disturbing the space too much. You could add a beeping sound when the bowl was not filled after n-minutes of blinking. -- Michelle Wang

For different dog sizes, it will be great to set the lower bound for the weight of each bowl as dogs with different sizes eat/drink different amounts of food/water. -- Scarlett Zhang



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
As in one of the feedbacks, where the device is located is really important. We tried with many different places but were worried that it would not be that noticeable. We first tried to stick the device on the wall where the bowls are located, but it could also be ignored when we acted it out. So we chose to put it on a higher side table next to the bowls. 

Also, we planned to use the smart lamp at the beginning, but the lamp was hard to costume while we had a better idea of how the device would look like. So eventually we decided to use the phone that can be costumed to how we think the device should look like.


\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


We initially planned for two scenarios, one for food only and one for water only. I chose to act out the interaction when I woke up in the morning as food would be usually eaten up by every morning, and I realized that water was out as well. Under such circumstances, a decision needed to be made regarding which color to show first if both are out, and a sequence needed to be performed as well if I add food/water one after the other. To simplify everything, we decided to add another color to the device, which is red when both need to be refilled. 



## Part C. Prototype the device


Unfortunately, we were unable to make Tinkerbelle on our phones. We got the python file to run successfully on our laptop with the port number, but we could never get connected to the port on our phones following the instructions. Therefore to save time, we decided to use another way to show different colors. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
 We intended the device to have a look that could intuitively imply it has something to do with the pet. So even the first-time users can go check the dog when they notice the lighting. We went with the rounded bone shape which is simple yet has enough space in the middle for a lighting panel, and a good weight-balance. This cute shape could also arouse some sympathy to go take care of the dog as soon as possible. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
