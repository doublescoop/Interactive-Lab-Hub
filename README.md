### Highlights 
-----
[üíä Blue Pill, Red Pill?](Lab%205/)

-  Morpheus Pill Dispenser uses face, color, and pose detection model from OpenCV to dispense a pill of user's choice. Inspired by the movie Matrix's famous [red pill moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7PKRjrid4), a 3d-printed Morpheus recognizes the user's face and stare(attention), prompts the user to choose a pill, recognizes the pill type, and dispenses accordinigly. 


[üêà üêà‚Äç‚¨õ A Tail of Two Kitties](https://github.com/doublescoop/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/438bf07b85cbc144bbeaf30306a7332dac5669e7/FinalProject/The%20Tail%20of%20Two%20Kitties.md)

- It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... A Tail of Two Kitties is entails two inter-connected soft rotbots, in a shape of friendly pet cats. Two(or more) pet robots can communicate through MQTT over long distance and activated with different interactions from the user(e.g. cats' heart lights up when more than one of the connected cats were touched by their users) It was primarily designed for long-distance friends, couples and families. Project inspired during the Covid19 when so many friends and families were separated.  : MQTT communication, Capacitive touch sensors, User Test, 3d laser cutting, 3d printing
